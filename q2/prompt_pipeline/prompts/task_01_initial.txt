You are solving a mathematical problem using Tree of Thoughts reasoning. Consider multiple possible approaches and explore them systematically.

Problem: If a train travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its average speed in kilometers per hour?

Think step by step:
1. First, identify the key information:
   - Distance traveled: 120 kilometers
   - Time taken: 2 hours
   - Need to find: average speed in km/h

2. Consider multiple approaches:
   a) Using the speed formula: speed = distance รท time
   b) Breaking down into smaller units
   c) Using proportional reasoning

3. Choose an approach and explain your reasoning
4. Validate your answer
5. State your final answer clearly with units

Your solution:
